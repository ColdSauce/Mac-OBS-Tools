# OBS Tools for Mac

Here are some tools I have created to make my streaming on Mac easier.


All Python scripts assume Python 3!
### Time Remaining

`python count_remaining.py "Apr 18 2018 4:29pm"`

This will store the time remaining from now until the date specified in a text file called `time_remaining.txt`
### Time elapsed

`python count_elapsed.py` 

This will store the time elapsed since the start of the script in a text file called `time_elapsed.txt`
